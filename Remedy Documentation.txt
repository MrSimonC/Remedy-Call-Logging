Remedy Logging Program
--------------------------------

Background:
This program reads in a CSC MDS.xls, loads the data into the program, then takes over a new IE instance to log the call into Remedy for you.

Prerequisite:
Install "Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 x86.exe" (on 32-bit, or x64 on 64-bit) which allows Python 3.5 dlls to work, found here:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48145

Installation and Running:
Setup your IE settings first: Tools, Options, Security: [This allows the Selenium to properly control the pop ups in IE]
	Internet, Uncheck "Enable Protected Mode"
	Local intranet, Uncheck "Enable Protected Mode"
	Trusted sites, Uncheck "Enable Protected Mode"
	Restricted sites, Uncheck "Enable Protected Mode"
	Close IE, Reopen and dismiss any warning message
Make a folder in "C:\Program Files\Remedy Logging System" (or another location of you choice) and put all the following files in there:
- settings.cfg
- IEDriverServer.exe
- Remedy.exe
Right click Remedy.exe and pin to start menu (for easy access)
Run by double clicking Remedy.exe

Notes:
In File, Settings, the sdplus_api_technician_key can be obtained via the sdplus section:

The one in the settings section below belongs to the Admin user.
